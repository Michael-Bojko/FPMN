# Factory Process Model and Notation (FPMN)

The Factory Process Model and Notation (FPMN) has been developed as part of a PhD Thesis at the Mechanical Engineering at Chemnitz University of Technology.

As a prototype implementation FPMN has been implemented in Microsoft Visio 2019 based on the BPMN 2.0 Shapes.
This repository includes the shapes to generate FPMN diagrams using MS Visio.
