# Factory Process Model and Notation (FPMN)

The Factory Process Model and Notation (FPMN) has been developed as part of a PhD Thesis at the Department Mechanical Engineering at Chemnitz University of Technology.

As a prototype implementation FPMN has been implemented in Microsoft Visio 2019 based on the BPMN 2.0 Shapes.
This repository includes the shapes to generate FPMN diagrams using MS Visio.

For using the FPMN stencil MS Visio Professional is required as a prequisite to generate BPMN / FPMN Diagrams.
